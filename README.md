# Assignment 1

##Code organization
The *data* package contains the files generated by xjc from the file people.xsd.  
The *marshallutilities* package contains all classes with the methods doing the marshalling and unmarshalling tasks.
* *PeopleUnMarshaller*: methods for marshalling the classes of the *data* package to an XML file and unmarshalling an XML file in java classes  
* *JsonMarshaller*: methods for marshalling the  classes of the *data* package to a JSON file  

The *print* package contains the class *PrintUtilities* with methods for pretty printing the objects to stdout. 
The *test* package contains the *HealthProfileReader* class for reading and querying the XML file 'people.xml' (implemented with XPath
expressions) and the *TestMarshallUtilities* class for testing the *marshallutitlities* package.  

##How to run it
### HealthProfileReader
Usage: ```java test.HealthProfileReader [method and parameters]```  

where [method and parameters] can be:
* ```weight [id]``` : print the weight of the person identified with [id]  
* ```height [id]``` : print the height of the person identified with [id]  
* ```print_profile [id]``` : print the healthprofile of the person identified with [id]  
* ```print_people``` : print all persons  
* ```filter_weight [ < | > | = ] [weight] ``` : print the person which weight satisfies the condition, for example 
```filter_weight '>' 50``` prints all persons having a weight greater than 50 kg.  

### TestMarshallUtitlities
Usage: ```java test.TestMarshallUtilities [marshallXML | unmarshallXML | marshallJSON] [file]```

* ```marshallXML```: marshalls the test data as XML in the file specified in [file]
* ```unmarshallXML```: reads the data from the XML file specified in [file] and prints them to stdout  
* ```marshallJSON```: marshalls the test data as JSON in the file specified in [file]
